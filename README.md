### Hello! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Jeffrey Chan. I completed my Bachelors's of Software Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada. I decided to pursue studying Software Engineering when I fell in love with programming working as a student researcher. Seeing the possibilities of programming I wanted to make it a tool I use in my career to solve problems, this led me to find Data Engineering.

I have spent my academic and work experience developing skills in programming Python, Java and SQL to expand the tools I have available spanning Amazon Web Services (AWS) to TensorFlow, PySpark and other Data Engineering tools.

I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-chak-him-chan/) if you share an interest in any of the topics I mentioned.

All the best.

Jeff
